This repository contains the solutions and implementations from my Algorithm Laboratory coursework. The lab focuses on applying core graph algorithms to solve real competitive programming problems using BFS, Dijkstra, and Bellman–Ford.
# Lab Report 1 — BFS Problems
Covers fundamental traversal using Breadth-First Search (BFS) for bipartite checking, shortest-path computation, and grid-based movement.
